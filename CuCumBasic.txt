Running from Testng Runner and testng.xml

We need below two dependency for Running from Testng Runner and testng.xml
       <dependency>
			<groupId>org.testng</groupId>
			<artifactId>testng</artifactId>
			<version>6.14.3</version>
			<scope>test</scope>
		</dependency>

		<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.cucumber/cucumber-testng -->
		<dependency>
			<groupId>io.cucumber</groupId>
			<artifactId>cucumber-testng</artifactId>
			<version>3.0.2</version>
		</dependency>

## If you want to run through TestNG then you need different runner
file. Below the runner file.-->


@CucumberOptions(
        features = "src/test/resources/",
        glue = {"com.qtpselenium.cucumber"},
        tags = {"@BookAirTickets,@BookHotelTickets,@Registeration"},
        plugin = {
              
                "html:target/cucumber-reports/cucumber-pretty",
                "json:target/cucumber-reports/CucumberTestReport.json",
                "rerun:target/cucumber-reports/rerun.txt"
        })
        
public class CucumberProjectTestngRunner extends AbstractTestNGCucumberTests{
   
}


It is almost same as Junit Runner file only different you need to 
extends 'AbstractTestNGCucumberTests' with your Runner class.
Here my runner class is "CucumberProjectTestngRunner"
Same @CucumberOptions.
